Ledger
Hi user! This ledger program controls the money flow status between people and people such like renting, borrowing, debt activities. The initial intend was to manage debt money between I and my roomates. Many language are accepted, I built the logic foundation in C++ and I will try to build a GUI.
I did not use a database since I havenot learnt about that. But I use a datastructure that keeps track of amount of money borrowing and lenting, inwhich kept in Expenses class.
